		<meta name="description" content="A chessboard with 64 squares that are placed in rows on an 8x8 grid is used to play the two-player board game known as classic chess. A king, a queen, two knights, two rooks, two bishops, and eight pawns are among each players initial 16 pieces. In this game of chess, the objective is to checkmate the opposing king in order to put him in immediate risk of being captured. On the same device, the game can be played solo with artificial intelligenceÂ or with a friend. The game also contains chess problem-solving capabilities.">
