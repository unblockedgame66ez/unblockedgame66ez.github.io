		<meta name="description" content="Street Cricket is a game that will bring back childhood memories. Street Cricket is a casual game with attractive graphics and noises. Each round begins with a target, ball, and wickets. As soon as the ball reaches you, tap to hit it. With the power bar, you can shoot higher. More high power bars equals more runs. Simply start tapping and hitting the shots. Its cricket time. So grab your bat and begin hitting sixes.">
