		<meta name="description" content="Stacking Challenge is an interesting stack-building game. Playing this game is both simple and tough. Youll notice some moving hooks transporting the blocks. These blocks are constantly going left to right and right to left. As soon as you see hooks over the stack, click or tap. The hooks will leave the blocks and expand the stack. If all of the blocks are in the stack, you will receive a score plus bonus points. Each round will last three minutes, and you can play as many times as you like.">
