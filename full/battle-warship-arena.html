Five distinct ships and five distinct captains, each with their own specialties and prowess, are available for selection. Your warships speed, armor, firepower, and other features can all be upgraded. You must eliminate every adversary ship while remaining inside the red circle to succeed in each level. Your warship will continuously sustain damage if you stray outside the circle until it sinks. So are you ready to rule the seas?">
